# Java-multithreaded-nbody-simulation

I used an existing n-body simulation which I made in MATLAB, converted it to Java, and implemented basic multithreading to delegate subtasks within the nested loop of the sequential program to separate threads.
The program computes the total force on each object in an n-body simulation using the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential. The workload of the program is divided between sections of the outer loop and the inner loop. Thus, the threads are arranged in a grid. Different threads work on different parts of the loop, indexed by threadIdxX and threadIdxY. X corresponds to parts of the inner loop, and Y corresponds to parts of the outer loop. The run() method computes a section of the total force and adds it to the current bodyForces array in the right entry.
Overall, this separation of tasks in each thread leads to a performance 8 times better than sequential code running on the main thread, and 2x better than threads only working on the outer loop.
